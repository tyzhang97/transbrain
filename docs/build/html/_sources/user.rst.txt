User Guide
=============

Considering the different needs of users, we provide **three levels of usage options**.


`Online Mapping <online_mapping.rst>`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- We provide a user-friendly, code-free `website <https://transbrain.streamlit.app/>`_ which enables users to directly upload data for online mapping and visualization.
- This is the easiest way to get started with TransBrain, ideal for users with no programming experience.
- Users only need to upload region-level phenotype data table as ``CSV`` files or volumetric data in ``.nii`` or ``.nii.gz`` format to get the mapping results.



`General Use <cases.rst>`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- The supported data format is the same as Online Mapping. 
- This way is more suitable for users with some basic knowledge of ``Python``. TransBrain can be seamlessly integrated into your research to analyze your results.
- You can use the embedded functions of TransBrain to map your data according to the detailed guidance in :ref:`API` and :ref:`tutorial-section`.


`Advanced Use <building.rst>`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- The complete construction pipeline of TransBrain is also publicly available.
