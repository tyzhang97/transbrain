Advanced Use
========================================

- Here we provide a step-by-step guide to follow the TransBrain construction pipeline.

- If you have more specific needs (such as constructing mapping matrices based on your own data or atlases), this tutorial will help you.

- On each page you can find a brief introduction of the data and methods, for detailed description please refer to our `paper <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.01.27.635016v2.abstract>`_.

- Due to the large data size, the dataset is not included in the GitHub repository. If needed, you can download it from the link in ``pipeline/datasets/README.md`` and place it in the same directory.


1. **Spatial Transcriptomic Matching**

- We integrated complementary human transcriptomic datasets, including `microarray data <http://human.brain-map.org>`_ and large-scale `single-nucleus RNA sequencing data <https://github.com/linnarsson-lab/adult-human-brain?tab=readme-ov-file>`_.  
- A detached deep neural network model was trained on the integrated transcriptomic data to learn region-specific latent embeddings that are generalizable across species.

2. **Graph-based Random Walk**

- A heterogeneous graph was constructed to connect brain regions within and across species.   
- Latent embeddings capturing integrated transcriptomic, anatomical, and connectivity information were generated.

3. **Bidirectional Mapping**

- `Dual-regression <./methods/mapping.rst>`_ method was employed to map phenotypes cross species, using the latent embeddings defined previously.
