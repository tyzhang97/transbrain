Frequently Asked Questions
====================================

1. If the atlas I use is not supported by TransBrain, can I still perform mapping with TransBrain?

At present, for other atlases, you can either follow our tutorial to build your own mapping matrix from scratch, or alternatively, select a most similar supported atlas to yours and transform your data to it using spatial-based weighting, then you can use TransBrain directly.
