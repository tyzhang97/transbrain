User Guide
=============

To accommodate different needs, we provide **three levels** of usage options and we believe the first two ways can meet the needs of most users.


`General Use <general_use.rst>`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Click `here <./general_use.rst>`_ to learn general usages.
- This way is the preferred option if you already have ROI-level phenotype data or volumetric data in ``.nii`` or ``.nii.gz`` format that has been aligned to the atlas space required by TransBrain.
- You can use the embedded functions of TransBrain to map your data according to the detailed guidance in :ref:`API` and :ref:`tutorial-section`.


`Online Mapping <https://transbrain.streamlit.app/>`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- We also provide a very user-friendly, code-free way for users.
- The same data preparation with **General Use**.
- This website (https://transbrain.streamlit.app/) enables users to directly upload your data for online mapping and visualization.


`Advanced Use <building.rst>`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- The complete construction pipeline of TransBrain is also publicly available.
- If you want to understand the detailed methodology of TransBrain or adapt it to your specific needs, please go to :ref:`build_method` section for details.
