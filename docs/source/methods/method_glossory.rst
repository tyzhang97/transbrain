    Cross-species homology mapping
        Cross-species homology region mapping involves identifying conserved genomic regions between different species that share similar functions or evolutionary origins.


    Neural network 
        A neural network is a computational model inspired by the way biological neural networks in the brain process information. It consists of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that work together to solve complex tasks such as classification, regression, and pattern recognition.
        

    Embeddings
        Embeddings represent high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space, while preserving important relationships and patterns. They also help capture semantic similarities, allowing for better generalization and improved performance.


    Gene enrichment analysis
        Gene enrichment analysis identifies biological functions or pathways that are overrepresented in a specific gene set, helping to reveal the underlying molecular processes or disease mechanisms.


    Human-Mouse Graph
        The Human-Mouse graph is a graph structure used to represent the similarities between brain regions in humans and mice. In this graph, brain regions from both species are represented as nodes, and the edges (connections) between nodes are weighted based on transcriptional similarity and structural connectivity. 


    Random Walk
        A random walk explores a graph to learn node embeddings based on their neighborhood structures. In TransBrain, Node2Vec algorithm was used, with the probability of moving to a neighbor depending on the graph structure and walk parameters.


    Dual regression
        Dual regression is a method used in neuroimaging to project group-level patterns (such as brain networks derived from Independent Component Analysis, ICA) onto individual subject data. Previous work have also employed this method to translate brain phenotypes across species using  gene expression data.

    Phenotype
        In neuroscience, phenotype refers to the observable characteristics or traits of the brain, including brain structure, function, and individual behavior. Phenotypic traits can include aspects such as cognitive abilities, neural connectivity, or responses to stimuli, and they are often studied to understand the biological basis of diseases or neurological disorders.
    
    Functional gradients
        Functional gradients refer to inherent patterns of brain activity or connectivity that smoothly transition across different brain regions, reflecting the gradual shift in neural function and cognitive processes within the brain's organization.

    Co-activation patterns (CAPs)
        Co-activation patterns (CAPs) are brain activity patterns where different regions are activated together, used to study functional brain networks and their collaboration during tasks or rest.

    Optogenetic fMRI
        Optogenetic fMRI combines optogenetics and functional MRI to control and monitor brain activity. By using light to stimulate specific neurons that have been genetically modified to express light-sensitive proteins, researchers can map the causal relationship between neural activity and brain function in real time.

        Deformation-based morphology (DBM) is a technique used to study structural brain changes by analyzing the spatial deformation of brain images. It involves mapping brain structures between individual subjects and a common template to detect differences in brain volume.

    Normative model
        Normative model is a statistical method that represents typical brain structure or function in a healthy population. It serves as a baseline or reference to compare individual data, helping identify deviations that may indicate abnormalities, such as in neurological or psychiatric disorders.
