Tutorials
========================================


Basic Use
----------------------
Here, we provide two basic examples demonstrating how to use TransBrain functions to map phenotypes from mouse to human, or from human to mouse.

- `Basic use: from mouse to human <tutorials/notebooks/basic_usage/basic_use_mouse_to_human.ipynb>`_.
- `Basic use: from human to mouse <tutorials/notebooks/basic_usage/basic_use_human_to_mouse.ipynb>`_.

Application Cases
----------------------
Next, we provide three examples of how to use TransBrain for cross-species comparison in specific research background, including the mapping of functional gradients, optogenetic activation, and disease deviation pattern.

- `Inferring the conservation of resting-fMRI gradients across species <tutorials/notebooks/translation/gradient_spectrum/fMRI_gradients.ipynb>`_.
- `Annotating the optogenetic circuits in mice using Neurosynth <tutorials/notebooks/translation/optogenetic_annotation/optogenetic_circuits.ipynb>`_.
- `Linking gene mutations to imaging phenotype deviations in autism <tutorials/notebooks/translation/autism_mutation/gene_mutations.ipynb>`_.
