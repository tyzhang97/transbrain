# Pipeline

- Here we provide a step-by-step guide to follow the TransBrain construction pipeline. 

- If you have more specific needs (such as constructing mapping matrices based on your own data or atlases), this tutorial will help you.

- Due to the large data size, the dataset is not included in the GitHub repository. If needed, you can download it from the link in ``/datasets/README.md`` and place it in the same directory.
